* Emacs Theme Switcher

A simple program that switches between two themes at the desired time

** How to use it

The config is quite simple, you just need to set both of the themes and the hours when you want the theme to switch  

=day-theme= is the day theme.  
=night-theme= is the night theme.  

=day-hour= is the hour of the switch in the morning.  
=night-hour= is the hour of the switch in the evening.  

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(require 'theme-switcher)

;; Set the light and dark theme
(setq day-theme 'spacemacs-light)
(setq night-theme 'spacemacs-dark)

;; Set the hour when you want the theme to switch
(setq day-hour 07)
(setq night-hour 18)
#+END_SRC
